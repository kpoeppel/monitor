"""Tests for PER-EVENT restart budgets (``MaxActionFiresCondition``).

The motivating requirement: different events need different restart allowances.
A benign wall-clock rollover should be allowed to fire ~150 times (a 15 TT
schedule needs ~91 healthy segments); a "no training step" stall should be
allowed only ~3 before a human is asked.

``MaxAttemptsCondition`` cannot express that, because it reads the JOB-WIDE
``runtime.attempts`` — every event shares one counter, so on a chained run the
healthy rollovers spend the stall event's budget and silently disable it. These
tests pin the difference down.

See ``MaxActionFiresCondition`` / ``MonitorLoop._update_action_state`` /
``MonitorLoop._evaluate_event_condition``.
