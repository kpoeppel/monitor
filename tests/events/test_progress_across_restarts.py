"""A ``progress_mode: furthest`` streak must survive a restart; its CLOCK must not.

Without this, a restart LOOP is invisible to the progress events. Each cycle is
a fresh SLURM job, ``_restart_job`` wipes ``runtime.events``, and the streak
never reaches its window -- so the only bound left is the blunt
per-event restart budget. Keeping the furthest iteration reached makes "the job keeps
relaunching and never gets back past the iteration it already reached"
detectable, which is precisely what ``progress_mode: furthest`` means.

The subtlety is the clock. A restart is followed by an unbounded queue wait, and
``_process_log_events`` returns early while the new job's log does not exist, so
no poll touches the record in between. Anchoring ``first_seen_ts`` at restart
time would fold that entire wait into ``elapsed_s`` and silently reduce the AND
in ``progress_qualifies`` to its poll-count half. The record is therefore flagged
for re-anchoring and gets its clock from the first poll that sees a log.

The queue is simulated by UNLINKING the local job's log: the monitor gates purely
on ``log_path.exists()``, which is exactly the property that makes a PENDING
SLURM job invisible to it.
