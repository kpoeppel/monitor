"""A timed exit must roll the run over, not end it.

A trainer with a wall-clock budget ends its segment with ``sys.exit(0)``, so
SLURM reports COMPLETED and the monitor's terminal branch marks the run
"finished" -- even though the schedule is barely started. An
``exit_duration_rollover`` log event turns that clean exit back into a restart.

What makes the pattern safe is that the two exits come from mutually exclusive
code paths:

  * the duration branch prints ``exiting program after <N> minutes`` from INSIDE
    the training loop and leaves via ``sys.exit``, so ``after training is done``
    is never reached;
  * a genuinely finished schedule leaves the loop normally and prints
    ``after training is done``.

So the line can only ever be emitted mid-schedule, and a ``finished_training``
event stays the sole authority on real completion. The rules themselves live in
a job policy rather than in this library, so they are built inline here.
