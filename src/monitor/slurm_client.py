    This client implements the JobClientProtocol to allow monitor to track

    background processes with output redirected to log files.

    Example:
        >>> client = LocalCommandClient()

        >>> statuses = client.squeue()

        - Processes are started in a new session (detached from terminal)
        - Job IDs are simple incrementing integers
        - No array job support for start_index parameter
