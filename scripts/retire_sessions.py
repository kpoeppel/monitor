"""Close out monitor sessions whose jobs are long gone. Run ON the cluster.

A monitor that is killed -- login node reboot, Ctrl-C, a crash -- never gets to
write ``final_state`` on the jobs it was watching. The records stay "active"
forever. On a busy cluster this is the common case rather than the exception:
one measurement found 367 of 506 session directories still holding such a
record, months after the jobs themselves ended.

That is not just untidy. Every tool that reads the state directory has to guess
which sessions matter, and some of those sessions hold records with
``submitted: false`` -- so anything that naively "resumes what looks active"
would *submit old work*.

This script resolves them instead of flattening them. For every unfinished
record it asks SLURM what actually happened and writes the real answer:

    COMPLETED                                   -> final_state "finished"
    FAILED / CANCELLED / TIMEOUT / NODE_FAIL    -> final_state "cancelled"
    not in sacct any more, or never submitted   -> final_state "retired"

``finished`` and ``cancelled`` are the vocabulary the monitor itself uses, so
retired sessions read exactly like ones that ended under supervision. Verified
that sacct still answers for two-week-old job ids, so the real outcome is worth
recovering while it is still recoverable.

    python scripts/retire_sessions.py --state-dir monitor_state           # dry run
    python scripts/retire_sessions.py --state-dir monitor_state --apply
    python scripts/retire_sessions.py --session-dir monitor_state/1786722705 --apply

SAFETY
  * Dry run by default; nothing is written without ``--apply``.
  * A session with a job in the queue RIGHT NOW is skipped entirely, so a live
    run can never be retired out from under its monitor.
  * Provenance goes in ``runtime.action_state["retired"]``, never in a new
    top-level field: ``JobFileStore.load_all`` silently skips records it cannot
    parse, so an unknown key would make the job VANISH from monitoring rather
    than raise. (Verified.)
